Project: Plant Growth
After reading the book Bringing Nature Home: How You can Sustain Wildlife with native Plants by Douglas W. Tallamy, I was inspired to start growing local native plants by seed. I thought it would be fun to experiment a little with the plant growing, so I came up with a few conditions to test my seeds for the season. The first experiment was to vary how much sun each plant would get, either it would always be in direct sunlight (full sun), be in sunlight for some of the day (partial sun) or never get direct sunlight. After watching some videos by Epic Gardening (a San Diego garden youtube channel) I decided to also experiment with liquid fertilizers, to see if that would strengthen the plants. 

In this program, I simulate the growth that I observed in my home garden. Each plant is “planted” and then grows depending on the conditions it is growing under. I imagine that in the future we can turn this into a fun idle game where we set up different plants and watch them grow. 

A note: We are unable to submit accurately through codeHS due to their outdated version of JAVA. Our code uses String.repeat(), introduced in Java 11. This will run in a modern Java runtime. Hence why we are submitting a zip with the java program and a readme.
